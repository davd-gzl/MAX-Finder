# User flows

The canonical map of what a user can do in MAX Finder and how each flow behaves. Keep
this in sync with the app — see the rule in `AGENTS.md` ("Living documentation"): any
change to a user-facing flow must update this file in the same PR.

## Top level: three tabs + a smart form

A user picks a tab, then fills the form. The tab plus which fields are filled decides the
search (`deriveMode` in `src/app.ts`; dispatch in `renderSearch`).

| Tab | Filled fields | Mode | Flow |
|-----|---------------|------|------|
| **Trip** (`simple`) | From + To | `od` | exact trip (one-way or round trip) |
| **Trip** | only From | `from` | browse / discovery *from* a station |
| **Trip** | only To | `to` | browse *into* a station |
| **Multi-city** (`multi`) | legs or cities | `tour` | a multi-stop tour |
| **Ideas** (`ideas`) | From | `best` | best destinations, ranked |

The **trip-type control** sits beside the date: an **`Aller simple` / `Aller-retour`**
(one-way / round trip) segmented toggle — the same sliding-pill style as the main tabs.
When *Aller-retour* is on, a **nights stepper** appears — `[ − ] N [ + ]` with a "Durée sur
place" label — where **0 = "Journée"** (a same-day round trip, metric = hours on site) and
**N = N nights** at the destination (the return is derived as departure + N, adjustable on
the return calendar). Beside the stepper is a **"Flexible" pill**: tapping it switches the
round trip out of fixed-nights mode so you pick the **exact departure and return on the
Trip-tab calendar** (Ulysse-style). While Flexible is active the fixed-nights stepper stays
**in place but inert (dimmed, buttons disabled)** rather than being removed — so toggling
Flexible never moves the "Durée sur place" label or reflows the row (no layout jump); only
the pill lights up. The form's stay becomes `flexible`. Tapping the stepper or a segment leaves
Flexible again. The stepper (and the pill) are hidden for one-way. `r` toggles one-way ↔
round trip (keeping the nights count, never Flexible); `1/2/3` switch tabs. Toggling,
stepping, or picking Flexible re-runs in place (no second Search tap when origin +
destination + date are set). Legacy `?rt=day` / `?rt=round` / `?rdate=` deep links still
resolve (rt=day or rdate==date → round trip, stepper on 0; a later rdate → the matching
nights; `rt=round` or an rdate more than 3 nights out → Flexible). Internally the stay maps
to the `StayChoice` model (`sameday`/`n1..n3`/`flexible`); Flexible carries its explicit
return date on `query.returnDate` (URL `stay=flex` + `rdate`).

The **Trip tab's date picker is a live availability calendar on the form itself**
(`repaintFormCalendar` in `src/app.ts`, painted into `refs.formCalendar` via
`render.calendarEl`). It sits under the date + trip-shape row behind a one-tap
**"When to leave?"** header (which also shows the picked departure) and is **collapsed by
default** so the form stays short on a phone — one tap opens the month to change the day.
The header names the calendar once (the in-body `<h3>` is rendered `sr-only` via
`calendarEl`'s `hideTitle`, so "When to leave?" isn't written twice). It **recomputes whenever origin,
destination, the Aller simple / Aller-retour toggle, or the nights stepper change**, so a
green day always means *a trip is possible that day* for the current choice:

| State | Builder (reused) | Green means |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| no origin yet | — (neutral month) | any day, tappable — with a "pick a departure station" hint |
| origin + dest, one-way | `availabilityCalendar` | a departure exists that day (count = trains) |
| origin + dest, same day (0 nights) | `dayTripCalendar` | a same-day there-and-back works (count = hours on site) |
| origin + dest, N nights | `roundTripCalendar` | an N-night round trip is feasible (count = nights) |
| origin only, one-way | `reachableCountCalendar` | you can leave that day (count = destinations) |
| origin only, round / same day | `getawayIdeas().perDay` | a getaway is possible that day (count = destinations) |

Tapping a green day sets the departure (`query.date` + the form's date field); with both
endpoints filled it also shows/refreshes that day's trip in place. It reuses the same option
helpers (`odConnOptsFor` / `getawayOptsFor`) as the real search, so the per-day journey
sweeps hit the warm memo caches; origin typing is debounced. The compact date pill above it
stays as the exact-date / ±flex keyboard entry for power users.

**In Flexible mode the same inline calendar becomes a departure→return RANGE picker**
(`pickFormRange`, driven by `calendarEl`'s `range` option). The **first tap sets the
departure** and arms the calendar for the return (`formRangeAwait`); the **next tap on/after
it sets the return** — `query.returnDate` with `stay: "flexible"` — and (route complete) runs
the flexible round trip in place, while an earlier tap just restarts. A **third tap begins a
fresh range**. The days between the two picked endpoints (both `.sel`) get a `.range` band,
and while the return is being chosen hovering previews the pending span (`.preview`).
Availability is shown exactly as the single-date calendar (round-trip feasibility). The
collapsed header spells out the two endpoints ("Aller: … → Retour: …", or a "choose the
return" prompt); `syncFormFromQuery` restores the highlighted range from `stay=flex` +
`rdate`. Fixed-nights and one-way modes keep the single-date departure picker; only Flexible
turns on range selection. The results-page return calendar still handles the return too —
this only adds the pick on the **first page**.

**Max correspondances** (0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / no limit) is a **main-form field**, not buried in
Advanced. **Night trains are included by default.** On the results screen, once a specific
date is chosen the possible-days calendar is **collapsed by default** (one tap to reveal
other dates); it stays expanded only during discovery (no exact date/destination yet).

## Trip tab

1. **From + To, One-way** → exact one-way trip (`runOdSearch`). The 30-day availability
   calendar is **collapsed by default** behind a "Departure: <date> · Change" toggle (the
   date is already chosen; the strip only re-appears on tap), above the selected day's train
   list. Tap a green day to move; tap a train to book (direct → deep link; connecting →
   step-by-step).
2. **From + To, a stay chosen** → the round-trip flow (`runTripSearch`). Two-leg accordion,
   with linked calendars:
   - **Leg 1 Outbound** — possible-days calendar collapsed as "Departure: <date> · Change"
     (it mirrors the form date, never re-asks it); below it the day's outbound trains.
     Clicking a departure day **restarts the return calendar from that day** (departure + N
     for a fixed stay, else same-day-first). Pick a train → it collapses to a ✓ summary and…
   - **Leg 2 Return** opens (gently revealed only if below the fold — a calendar tap never
     scrolls the drawer up) — a return calendar whose **first cell is the same day** (hours
     on site), later cells are nights at the destination, pre-selected to the stay's return.
     For a **fixed** N-night stay the return is derived with no second question, so its
     calendar is **collapsed by default** behind a "Return: <date> · Change" toggle (same
     `.cal-collapsible` / `.cal-toggle` / `.cal-panel` pattern as the outbound one). In
     **Flexible** mode the return calendar **stays open** (it is the return-length control):
     tapping a day sets `query.returnDate` and keeps the stay `flexible`. Pick a return →
   - **Trip modal** = booking recap: an unmistakable per-leg action — "Book the outbound" /
     "Book the return" (each deep-links SNCF Connect; a connecting leg opens the step modal)
     — plus Save the whole trip. Back inside the accordion re-opens the outbound before it
     exits the flow (step-wise back).
3. **Only From, One-way** → browse (`runBrowse` "from"). Every destination reachable from the
   station, ranked by how well-served it is, with availability. Tap a card → the exact trip.
4. **Only From, a stay chosen** → discovery (`runGetaways`), "Where can you get away to?".
   Destinations ranked by **time at the destination** (hours on site if same-day is best,
   else nights) + a possible-start-days calendar. Tap a day → narrows to that day
   (auto-scrolls to results). Tap a destination → opens the round trip.
   - Ranking: `sortGetaways` puts most hours-on-site first for same-day trips.
   - A minimum-on-site gate exists in core (`minOnSiteMin`, default 4h); NOT yet exposed as
     an Advanced control. (Open item.)
5. **Only To** → reverse browse (`runBrowse` "to"): where you can come *from* to reach the
   station.

## Multi-city tab (tour)

- **Custom legs** — spell out each hop (from → to @ date). "Surprise me" fills a random
  reachable next stop; can build a whole trip from an empty editor.
- **Tour planner** — add cities to visit (or "Surprise" / "Nearest stop"), set days-per-city;
  it auto-orders a feasible tour. Save as a tour.

## Ideas tab (best)

Best free-MAX destinations from the origin, ranked (fastest / most-served / closest…),
either an all-days overview or one specific day. Tap → open the route.

## Cross-cutting (everywhere)

- **Map** — full-bleed behind a results drawer on mobile, side panel on desktop. Markers per
  destination, hover/selection synced with the list; route line for exact trips; auto-fits
  above the drawer on mobile.
- **Saved & Favorites** — star a route / save a trip, from the header menu. (The two overlap
  — a known cleanup item.)
- **Settings** — theme, MAX Jeune/Senior, comfortable/compact, and Low-end mode (map off +
  reduced motion + compact) with a one-time nudge on weak devices; language.
- **Mobile** — the form is a sheet that collapses to a search bar; results are a bottom-sheet
  drawer with detents. Back navigation preserves form state and never lands on a dead screen.
- **Deep links** — every search is a shareable URL; legacy `?rdate=` / `?rt=` links still work.
- **PWA** — installable; a "new version — reload" postcard on updates.

## Known open items (see docs/trip-redesign.md for the audit plan)

- Expose the minimum-time-on-site gate in Advanced (discovery).
- Collapse the two save systems (favorite star + Save bookmark) into one.
- One `openRoute()` primitive (list cards / favorites / map pins behave consistently).
- One home for the availability calendar (form popover vs results).
- Mobile browser-Back should close detail pages via history.
